<p class="docText"><a name="idd1e762"></a><a name="idd1e765"></a><a name="idd1e768"></a>Rich Stevens and I first met through an e-mail exchange when I reported a typographical error in his first book, <span class="docEmphasis">UNIX Network Programming</span>. He used to kid me about being the person to send him his first errata notice for the book. Until his death in 1999, we exchanged e-mail irregularly, usually when one of us had a question we thought the other might be able to answer. We met for dinner at USENIX conferences and when Rich was teaching in the area.</P>
<p class="docText">Rich Stevens was a friend who always conducted himself as a gentleman. When I wrote <span class="docEmphasis">UNIX System V Network Programming</span> in 1993, I intended it to be a System V version of Rich's <span class="docEmphasis">UNIX Network Programming</span>. As was his nature, Rich gladly reviewed chapters for me, and treated me not as a competitor, but as a colleague. We often talked about collaborating on a STREAMS version of his <span class="docEmphasis">TCP/IP Illustrated</span> book. Had events been different, we might have actually done it, but since Rich is no longer with us, revising <span class="docEmphasis">Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</span> is the closest I'll ever get to writing a book with him.</P>
<p class="docText">When the editors at Addison-Wesley told me that they wanted to update Rich's book, I thought that there wouldn't be too much to change. Even after 13 years, Rich's work still holds up well. But the UNIX industry is vastly different today from what it was when the book was first published.</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docList">The System V variants are slowly being replaced by Linux. The major system vendors that ship their hardware with their own versions of the UNIX System have either made Linux ports available or announced support for Linux. Solaris is perhaps the last descendant of UNIX System V Release 4 with any appreciable market share.</P></li><LI><p class="docList"><a name="idd1e804"></a><a name="idd1e807"></a><a name="idd1e810"></a><a name="idd1e813"></a><a name="idd1e816"></a><a name="idd1e819"></a><a name="idd1e822"></a><a name="idd1e825"></a><a name="idd1e830"></a><a name="idd1e833"></a><a name="idd1e836"></a>After 4.4BSD was released, the Computing Science Research Group (CSRG) from the University of California at Berkeley decided to put an end to its development of the UNIX operating system, but several different groups of volunteers still maintain publicly available versions.</P></LI><li><p class="docList">The introduction of Linux, supported by thousands of volunteers, has made it possible for anyone with a computer to run an operating system similar to the UNIX System, with freely available source code for the newest hardware devices. The success of Linux is something of a curiosity, given that several free BSD alternatives are readily available.</P></li><LI><p class="docList">Continuing its trend as an innovative company, Apple Computer abandoned its old Mac operating system and replaced it with one based on Mach and FreeBSD.</P></LI></ul>
<p class="docText">Thus, I've tried to update the information presented in this book to reflect these four platforms.</P>
<p class="docText">After Rich wrote <span class="docEmphasis">Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</span> in 1992, I got rid of most of my UNIX programmer's manuals. To this day, the two books I keep closest to my desk are a dictionary and a copy of <span class="docEmphasis">Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</span>. I hope you find this revision equally useful.</P>
