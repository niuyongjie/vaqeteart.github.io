community of professionals using the versatile family of UNIX and
UNIX-like operating environments. It removes obsolescence and
includes newer developments. It also thoroughly updates the context
of all topics, examples, and applications to recent releases of
popular implementations of UNIX and UNIX-like environments. And
yet, it does all this while retaining the style and taste of the
original classic."--Mukesh Kacker, cofounder and former CTO of Pronto Networks,
Inc."One of the essential classics of UNIX programming."--Eric S. Raymond, author of The Art of UNIX
Programming"This is the definitive reference book for any serious or
professional UNIX systems programmer. Rago has updated and extended
the classic Stevens text while keeping true to the original. The
APIs are illuminated by clear examples of their use. He also
mentions many of the pitfalls to look out for when programming
across different UNIX system implementations and points out how to
avoid these pitfalls using relevant standards such as POSIX 1003.1,
2004 edition and the Single UNIX Specification, Version 3."--Andrew Josey, Director, Certification, The Open Group, and
Chair of the POSIX 1003.1 Working Group"Advanced Programming in the UNIX&#174; Environment, Second
Edition, is an essential reference for anyone writing programs
for a UNIX system. It's the first book I turn to when I want to
understand or re-learn any of the various system interfaces.
Stephen Rago has successfully revised this book to incorporate
newer operating systems such as GNU/Linux and Apple's OS X while
keeping true to the first edition in terms of both readability and
usefulness. It will always have a place right next to my
computer."--Dr. Benjamin Kuperman, Swarthmore CollegePraise for the First Edition"Advanced Programming in the UNIX&#174; Environment is a
must-have for any serious C programmer who works under UNIX. Its
depth, thoroughness, and clarity of explana-tion are
unmatched."--UniForum Monthly"Numerous readers recommended Advanced Programming in the
UNIX&#174; Environment by W. Richard Stevens (Addison-Wesley),
and I'm glad they did; I hadn't even heard of this book, and it's
been out since 1992. I just got my hands on a copy, and the first
few chapters have been fascinating."--Open Systems Today"A much more readable and detailed treatment of UNIX internals
can be found in Advanced Programming in the UNIX&#174;
Environment by W. Richard Stevens (Addison-Wesley). This book
includes lots of realistic examples, and I find it quite helpful
when I have systems programming tasks to do."--RS/Magazine"This is the definitive reference book for any serious or
professional UNIX systems programmer. Rago has updated and extended
the original Stevens classic while keeping true to the
original."--Andrew Josey, Director, Certification, The Open Group, and
Chair of the POSIX 1003.1 Working GroupFor over a decade, serious C programmers have relied on one book
for practical, in-depth knowledge of the programming interfaces
that drive the UNIX and Linux kernels: W. Richard Stevens'
Advanced Programming in the UNIX&#174; Environment.
Now, Stevens' colleague Stephen Rago has thoroughly updated this
classic to reflect the latest technical advances and add support
for today's leading UNIX and Linux platforms.Rago carefully retains the spirit and approach that made this
book a classic. Building on Stevens' work, he begins with basic
topics such as files, directories, and processes, carefully laying
the groundwork for understanding more advanced techniques, such as
signal handling and terminal I/O.Substantial new material includes chapters on threads and
multithreaded programming, using the socket interface to drive
interprocess communication (IPC), and extensive coverage of the
interfaces added to the latest version of the POSIX.1 standard.
Nearly all examples have been tested on four of today's most widely
used UNIX/Linux platforms: FreeBSD 5.2.1; the Linux 2.4.22 kernel;
Solaris 9; and Darwin 7.4.0, the FreeBSD/Mach hybrid underlying
Apple's Mac OS X 10.3.As in the first edition, you'll learn through example, including
more than 10,000 lines of downloadable, ANSI C source code. More
than 400 system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise,
complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments,
and return values. To tie together what you've learned, the book
presents several chapter-length case studies, each fully updated
for contemporary environments.Advanced Programming in the UNIX&#174; Environment
has helped a generation of programmers write code with exceptional
power, performance, and reliability. Now updated for today's
UNIX/Linux systems, this second edition will be even more
indispensable.
